## 1.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE
Basic mathematics is a fundamental life skill which is required to negoiate all facets of life. Getting a grasp on mathematics early in life has been proven to assist with problem solving, confidence and the ability to self learn. Mathematics is best learnt from practicing and the idea of implementing the game within a supermarket will give the player practice they can relate to in the real world. 

This game is targeted for ages seven to eleven and is designed in align with the requirements of mathematics in the Australian curriculum.   
The Shopping Trolley Game is an interactive, multi-level game which engages children of relevant age to practice their maths skills. The game is set out to be in a supermarket with the player using maths skills to complete their shop. 
The four level game is set out in four levels with the difficulty increasing as the game progresses. The game will include the following operations; addition and subtraction, multiplication, fractions, percentages, estimation, money and change.

For each level, the player will need to enter three correct answers to advance to the next level. At any stage during the game they have the ability to save and exit the game. If the player gets any question wrong within the level they will then be required to begin that level again. Once they have completed the four levels they will be congratulated and will have the choice to either begin again or exit the game.

## 1.2 FEATURES 
The shopping trolley game is enlisted with three features

#### 1. Four Levels
The game has four levels; Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert. The difference in the levels will determine what maths is required as the difficulty increases as the player progresses in the levels.                                          **The Beginner Level** will include basic addition and subtraction of supermarket items as well as item costs with whole values less than ten.     
**The Intermediate level** will include basic multiplication, fractions, handling money and receiving change.    
**The Advanced Level** will include a higher level of money handling and rounding and the addition and subtraction of fractions.          
**The Expert Level** will include revision of the previous concepts, addition and subtraction of decimals, and financial mathematics using percentage discounts. 

#### 2. Feature # 2 - potentially saving and exiting
#### 3. Feature # 3
